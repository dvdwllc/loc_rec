  <h1>Location Recommendation - Baltimore</h1>
    <h2>
    You asked for a good location near {{original_address}}.
    </h2>
    <p>Here is the heatmap (dark red is a good location, dark blue is bad).
        Based on the data, I recommend you search for a location near:<br><em>{{recommended_address}}</em>
    </p>
    <img src="{{ url_for('img', special_address = original_address) }}"  width='500' alt="recommendation map">
