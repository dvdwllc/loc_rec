  <h1>Location Recommendation - Baltimore</h1>
    <p>Here is the heatmap generated by your query (the hotter the better):
    <img src="{{ url_for('img') }}"  width='500' alt="recommendation map">
    </p>
    <p>Based on the data, I recommend you search for a location near:<br><em>{{recommended_address}}</em><br><br>
        Thanks for trying out this app! The following new features are coming soon:
        <ul>
            <li>More search criteria (restaurants, parks, bike lanes, etc.).</li>
            <li>Interface with Google Maps for more detailed recommendations.</li>
            <li>More aesthetically pleasing page design...</li>
        </ul>
